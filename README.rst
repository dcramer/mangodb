MangoDB
=======

MangoDB is one of the fastest databases in existence. It allows you to store ANY KIND OF DATA you want without any IO
bottleneck. You're only limited by the size of your pipe.

If you're familiar with MongoDB then you'll feel write at home with Mango. We'll instantly map all of your existing
data without ANY EFFORT with a new and improved AUTO SHARTING ALGORITHM.

Getting Started
---------------

Install ``gevent``::

    easy_install -U gevent

Run the server::

    python server.py

With your MongoDB client, connect to ``localhost`` on port ``27017``.

That's it! You'll enjoy the same reliability as you're used to with MongoDB, but you'll get your responses so fast
that you'll never want to go back!

First and foremost, I have to thank 10gen for creating one of the greatest databases ever. Without their amazing
marketing team, and their top notch broduct, we would not be able to build many of the great products on the web.
